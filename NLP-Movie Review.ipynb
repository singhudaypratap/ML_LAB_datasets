How can we teach a Neural Network to do this classification?\n","\n","Another problem is that neural networks cannot work directly on text-data, so we need to convert text into numbers that are compatible with a neural network.\n","\n","Yet another problem is that a text may be arbitrarily long. The neural networks we have worked with fixed data-shapes - except for the first dimension of the data which varies with the batch-size. Now we need a type of neural network that can work on both short and long sequences of text.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"voHEjzNF0nXt","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Flowchart\n","\n","To solve this problem we need several processing steps. First we need to convert the raw text-words into so-called tokens which are integer values. These tokens are really just indices into a list of the entire vocabulary. Then we convert these integer-tokens into so-called embeddings which are real-valued vectors, whose mapping will be trained along with the neural network, so as to map words with similar meanings to similar embedding-vectors. Then we input these embedding-vectors to a Recurrent Neural Network which can take sequences of arbitrary length as input and output a kind of summary of what it has seen in the input. This output is then squashed using a Sigmoid-function to give us a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is taken to mean a negative sentiment and 1.0 means a positive sentiment. This whole process allows us to classify input-text as either having a negative or positive sentiment.\n","\n","The flowchart of the algorithm is roughly:\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZkuHyNkI0nXt","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Recurrent Neural Network\n","\n","The basic building block in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a Recurrent Unit (RU). There are many different variants of recurrent units such as the rather clunky LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) and the somewhat simpler GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) which we will use in this tutorial. Experiments in the literature suggest that the LSTM and GRU have roughly similar performance. Even simpler variants also exist and the literature suggests that they may perform even better than both LSTM and GRU, but they are not implemented in Keras which we will use in this tutorial.\n","\n","The following figure shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit, which has an internal state that is being updated every time the unit receives a new input. This internal state serves as a kind of memory. However, it is not a traditional kind of computer memory which stores bits that are either on or off. Instead the recurrent unit stores floating-point values in its memory-state, which are read and written using matrix-operations so the operations are all differentiable. This means the memory-state can store arbitrary floating-point values (although typically limited between -1.0 and 1.0) and the network can be trained like a normal neural network using Gradient Descent.\n","\n","The new state-value depends on both the old state-value and the current input. For example, if the state-value has memorized that we have recently seen the word \"not\" and the current input is \"good\" then we need to store a new state-value that memorizes \"not good\" which indicates a negative sentiment.\n","\n","The part of the recurrent unit that is responsible for mapping old state-values and inputs to the new state-value is called a gate, but it is really just a type of matrix-operation. There is another gate for calculating the output-values of the recurrent unit. The implementation of these gates vary for different types of recurrent units. This figure merely shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit. The LSTM has more gates than the GRU but some of them are apparently redundant so they can be omitted.\n","\n","In order to train the recurrent unit, we must gradually change the weight-matrices of the gates so the recurrent unit gives the desired output for an input sequence. This is done automatically in TensorFlow.\n","\n","![Recurrent unit](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/images/20_recurrent_unit.png?raw=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"scesc8fD0nXu","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Unrolled Network\n","\n","Another way to visualize and understand a Recurrent Neural Network is to \"unroll\" the recursion. In this figure there is only a single recurrent unit denoted RU, which will receive a text-word from the input sequence in a series of time-steps.\n","\n","The initial memory-state of the RU is reset to zero internally by Keras / TensorFlow every time a new sequence begins.\n","\n","In the first time-step the word \"this\" is input to the RU which uses its internal state (initialized to zero) and its gate to calculate the new state. The RU also uses its other gate to calculate the output but it is ignored here because it is only needed at the end of the sequence to output a kind of summary.\n","\n","In the second time-step the word \"is\" is input to the RU which now uses the internal state that was just updated from seeing the previous word \"this\".\n","\n","There is not much meaning in the words \"this is\" so the RU probably doesn't save anything important in its internal state from seeing these words. But when it sees the third word \"not\" the RU has learned that it may be important for determining the overall sentiment of the input-text, so it needs to be stored in the memory-state of the RU, which can be used later when the RU sees the word \"good\" in time-step 6.\n","\n","Finally when the entire sequence has been processed, the RU outputs a vector of values that summarizes what it has seen in the input sequence. We then use a fully-connected layer with a Sigmoid activation to get a single value between 0.0 and 1.0 which we interpret as the sentiment either being negative (values close to 0.0) or positive (values close to 1.0).\n","\n","Note that for the sake of clarity, this figure doesn't show the mapping from text-words to integer-tokens and embedding-vectors, as well as the fully-connected Sigmoid layer on the output.\n","\n","![Unrolled network](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/images/20_unrolled_flowchart.png?raw=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rr54iU9J0nXv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 3-Layer Unrolled Network\n","\n","Recurrent Neural Network with 3 recurrent units (or layers) denoted RU1, RU2 and RU3 in the \"unrolled\" figure below.\n","\n","The first layer is much like the unrolled figure above for a single-layer RNN. First the recurrent unit RU1 has its internal state initialized to zero by Keras / TensorFlow. Then the word \"this\" is input to RU1 and it updates its internal state. Then it processes the next word \"is\", and so forth. But instead of outputting a single summary value at the end of the sequence, we use the output of RU1 for every time-step. This creates a new sequence that can then be used as input for the next recurrent unit RU2. The same process is repeated for the second layer and this creates a new output sequence which is then input to the third layer's recurrent unit RU3, whose final output is passed to a fully-connected Sigmoid layer that outputs a value between 0.0 (negative sentiment) and 1.0 (positive sentiment).\n","\n","Note that for the sake of clarity, the mapping of text-words to integer-tokens and embedding-vectors has been omitted from this figure.\n","\n","![Unrolled 3-layer network](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/images/20_unrolled_3layers_flowchart.png?raw=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"s19j2Uqt0nXv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Exploding & Vanishing Gradients\n","\n","In order to train the weights for the gates inside the recurrent unit, we need to minimize some loss-function which measures the difference between the actual output of the network relative to the desired output.\n","\n","From the \"unrolled\" figures above we see that the reccurent units are applied recursively for each word in the input sequence. This means the recurrent gate is applied once for each time-step. The gradient-signals have to flow back from the loss-function all the way to the first time the recurrent gate is used. If the gradient of the recurrent gate is multiplicative, then we essentially have an exponential function.\n","\n","In this tutorial we will use texts that have more than 500 words. This means the RU's gate for updating its internal memory-state is applied recursively more than 500 times. If a gradient of just 1.01 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 145. If a gradient of just 0.99 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 0.007. These are called exploding and vanishing gradients. The only gradients that can survive recurrent multiplication are 0 and 1.\n","\n","To avoid these so-called exploding and vanishing gradients, care must be made when designing the recurrent unit and its gates. That is why the actual implementation of the GRU is more complicated, because it tries to send the gradient back through the gates without this distortion."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"snp3-4wy0nXw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aElIJRD40nXx","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1600850415190,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3002,"user":{"displayName":"Mahesh Jangid","photoUrl":"","userId":"09491120556780306114"}}},"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f0ZwFRph0nX1","colab_type":"text"},"source":["We need to import several things from Keras."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"nKcJujx70nX2","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1600850415786,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3580,"user":{"displayName":"Mahesh Jangid","photoUrl":"","userId":"09491120556780306114"}}},"source":["from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GRU, Embedding\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e7AOP6pR0nX6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This was developed using Python 3.6 (Anaconda) and package versions:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":false,"id":"cVgqSu1u0nX7","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1600850415787,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3568,"user":{"displayName":"Mahesh Jangid","photoUrl":"","userId":"09491120556780306114"}},"outputId":"43ab7fe5-9096-4293-e21d-c2362ba2315b"},"source":["tf.__version__"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'2.3.0'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"1fGBwRx60nX_","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1600850415788,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3556,"user":{"displayName":"Mahesh Jangid","photoUrl":"","userId":"09491120556780306114"}},"outputId":"62d41d53-d278-4186-e75c-011459feff6a"},"source":["tf.keras.__version__"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'2.4.0'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BA0dNkjH0nYC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Load Data\n","\n","We will use a data-set consisting of 50000 reviews of movies from IMDB.
